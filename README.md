# E-Commerce Backend API with JWT Authentication

Before start using this app, it will be needed to create a .env file based on the existing .env_template

After the setup of the .env file, the next steps to run the app will be:

- just run the app with the command (run in the app base folder): *uvicorn main:app*
- open this URL in your browser and you will be able to test all endpoints: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

If needed, to the setup of e-mail validation - a guide on how to use gmail to send app e-mails:
